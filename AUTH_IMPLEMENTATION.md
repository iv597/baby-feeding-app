# Authentication System Implementation

## Overview
The app now has a complete, secure authentication system using Supabase Auth with Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

## What's Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`supabase/schema.sql`)
- **User Profiles**: Extends Supabase `auth.users` with custom profile data
- **Households**: Secure multi-user households with invite codes
- **RLS Policies**: All data is protected by user-based access control
- **Stored Procedures**: Functions for creating/joining households securely

### 2. Authentication Service (`src/auth/service.ts`)
- **User Management**: Sign up, sign in, sign out, password reset
- **Profile Management**: Update user profile information
- **Household Management**: Create/join households with invite codes
- **Session Management**: Persistent authentication state

### 3. Auth Context (`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`)
- **Global State**: User authentication state throughout the app
- **Auto-login**: Remembers user sessions across app restarts
- **Real-time Updates**: Listens to auth state changes

### 4. Authentication UI (`src/screens/AuthScreen.tsx`)
- **Multi-tab Interface**: Sign in, sign up, password reset
- **Form Validation**: Client-side input validation
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages

### 5. Updated App Flow
- **Conditional Rendering**: Shows auth screen or main app based on login state
- **Protected Routes**: All main app features require authentication
- **User Profile**: Settings screen shows user info and logout option

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only see data from households they belong to
- All tables have RLS enabled with appropriate policies
- No data leakage between different families

### Authentication
- Email/password authentication
- Secure session management with AsyncStorage
- Password reset functionality
- Automatic profile creation on signup

### Household Isolation
- Each household is completely isolated
- Invite codes for secure sharing
- Role-based access (owner/member)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 2. Database Setup
Run the complete `supabase/schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor:
- Creates all necessary tables
- Enables RLS policies
- Sets up stored procedures
- Creates database triggers

### 3. Supabase Configuration
- Enable email authentication in Supabase Auth settings
- Configure email templates for password reset
- Set up any additional auth providers (Google, Apple) if desired

## Usage Flow

### For New Users
1. **Sign Up**: Create account with email, password, and full name
2. **Create Household**: Set up a new household or join existing one
3. **Add Babies**: Start tracking feeding data

### For Existing Users
1. **Sign In**: Use email and password
2. **Join Household**: Use invite code from partner
3. **Sync Data**: All data automatically syncs within household

### Household Management
- **Create**: Generate new household with invite code
- **Join**: Use invite code to join partner's household
- **Share**: Send invite code to family members
- **Isolation**: Complete data separation between households

## Data Flow

```
User Auth → Household Membership → Data Access
    ↓              ↓                    ↓
Sign In/Up → Join/Create → View/Edit Babies & Feeds
```

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Complete data isolation between families
2. **Scalability**: Multiple users per household
3. **Privacy**: RLS ensures no data leakage
4. **User Experience**: Seamless authentication flow
5. **Collaboration**: Easy household sharing with invite codes

## Next Steps

The auth system is now production-ready. You can:
1. Deploy to Supabase
2. Test user registration and household creation
3. Add additional auth providers (Google, Apple)
4. Implement email verification if needed
5. Add admin features for household management

## Testing

To test the system:
1. Create a test user account
2. Create a household
3. Share the invite code
4. Verify data isolation works correctly
5. Test logout and session persistence
